##Project Name: AI for Greenwashing Detection

###Topic:
Companies often exaggerate their eco-friendly image — a practice known as greenwashing — to attract environmentally conscious customers and boost financial performance without actually bearing the full cost of sustainable practices. In this project, we aim to use AI to assess the authenticity of such claims and determine whether they are truly genuine or misleading.
